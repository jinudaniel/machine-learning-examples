# machine-learning-examples
Implemented the below mentioned Machine Learning algorithms.

* **K Nearest Neighbors**
Implemented K Nearest Neighbors using Pandas and Numpy. Used Iris dataset for training the algorithm

* **Linear Regression**
Implemented Linear regression using Numpy and Gradient descent

* **Logistic Regression**
Implemented Logistic regression using Numpy and Gadient Descent. Used Andrew Ng's Deep learning class as reference.

* **Neural Network**
Implemented Neural network from scratch using Numpy. Andrew Ng's Deep learning class was used as a reference.

* **Neural Network using Keras**
Implemented a 3 layer Neural Network using Keras framework. Data will be pima indians dataset.
