# machine-learning-examples
Implement the below mentioned Machine Learning algorithms.

* **K Nearest Neighbors**
Implement K Nearest Neighbors using Pandas and Numpy. Iris dataset was used to train this algorithm

* **Linear Regression**
Implement Linear regression using Numpy and Gradient descent

* **Logistic Regression**
Implement Logistic regression using Numpy and Gadient Descent. Used Andrew Ng's Deep learning class as reference.

* **Neural Network**
Build a Neural network from scratch using Numpy. Andrew Ng's Deep learning class was used as a reference.

* **Neural Network using Keras**
Build a 3 layer Neural Network using Keras framework. Data will be pima indians dataset.

* **Neural Network using Tensorflow**
Build a 3 layer Neural network using Tensorflow framework and MNIST dataset

* **Classifier using Scikit learn**
Build a fruit classifier using sklearn library. Used clasification algorithms Logistic Regression, Descision Tree, K Nearest Neighbours, Gaussin Naive Bayes and Support vector machine.
